Triangle Fraternity at Michigan Tech is on the move again, but this time it's into a new house near College Ave.

<!-- excerpt -->

The Chapter has reached an incredible milestone;
we are now the proud owners of our very own Chapter House! With the help
of the [Triangle Building and Housing Corporation (TBHC)](https://www.triangle.org/housing/),
the Chapter can continue to grow into it's new surroundings and focus on our
values based membership in a brand new (to us) house.

The Chapter has been renting our current house for quite some time now and it's suited
the chapter very well. There have been countless memories made, everlasting
friendships forged, and dozens of new members brought into the brotherhood within its walls. However, just as the
chapter is growing and maturing, so too must our facilities. We are excited for the move and ready to
make our new house, a home. Without the help of the TBHC and the Alumni, this feat never would have been possible by just the Active Chapter.

The purpose of the TBHC is to assist chapters of Triangle Fraternity in owning
and operating their chapter homes. Some chapter houses, like the
[University of Michigan Chapter](http://www.triangleumich.com/) and the
[Michigan State University Chapter](http://www.msutriangle.org/), are actually
owned by the TBHC to help the Alumni from those chapters with the day to day
operations of the property, while other chapters' houses are owned by some organization
formed by the Alumni of those chapters. We are excited to be one of the latest ventures that the TBHC is willing to take part in,
and are thankful that they have helped us complete a chapter in our history, and start a new all the same.
